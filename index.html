      <p>
        Music has been an integral part of my life from an early age, shaping both my personal identity and creative expression. Growing up in a Hispanic household, music was more than just background noiseâ€”it was a thread that connected family, tradition, and culture. From lively gatherings to quiet moments of reflection, I learned to appreciate the depth, diversity, and emotional power of music in everyday life.

        During high school, I had the honor of performing with a world-class ensemble, an experience that not only pushed my technical and collaborative skills to new heights but also showed me the transformative power of music when shared with others. These performances taught me discipline, resilience, and the joy of creating something larger than myself.

        Beyond performance, I explore music through composition, using it as a personal outlet to express ideas and emotions that words alone cannot convey. Composing allows me to combine technique, creativity, and cultural inspiration into works that are uniquely my own. This blend of family, heritage, performance, and creation continues to inspire my musical journey and drives my passion for exploring new ways to communicate through sound.
